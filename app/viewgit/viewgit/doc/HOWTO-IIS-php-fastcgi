The following howto for running ViewGit on Windows with IIS and php-fastcgi has
been provided by Troy Hamilton <troy.a.hamilton@gmail.com>:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn't see any information on the ViewGit sourceforge page about running it
on Windows with IIS and php-fastcgi, so I thought I'd send a note describing
the methods I employed to get it working.  (And it works really well, by the
way.)

First, I set up php-fastcgi for IIS as described here:
http://www.iis.net/expand/fastcgi

Next, I had to grant the Internet Guest Account read and execute permission to
cmd.exe in order to avoid php "Unable to fork" errors:
http://www.somacon.com/p255.php

Other than that, the included README file was sufficient, but I didn't mess
with any url rewriting, though.

I did have to make a couple of changes in the php code for the windows
environment, however:

cmd.exe treats the hat symbol (^) as an escape character, so on line 219 of
index.php, I had to change:
$text = git_diff($page['project'], "$hash^", $hash);

to this:
$text = git_diff($page['project'], "$hash~1", $hash);

I also had to do the same on line 235.

Similarly, I had to add a ^ character to escape the pipe on line 98:
run_git_passthru($project, "archive --format=tar $tree ^|gzip");

I also installed the gnuwin32 tools on the server for gzip.exe (tar.gz archives) and patch.exe.
